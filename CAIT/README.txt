Application Berlin Clock ----> By Vikti Desai


The console C# application is based on the famous Mengenlenheur clock commonly known as the Berlin Clock. 

There are several ways to design this application. I have designed it keeping in mind the code reusability and hence there are a number of methods which perform distinct tasks under the class Clocks.
The clock calculates time by counting the slots with a certain color scheme to follow. 

In the following console application there are different methods to set time, color scheme and printing out the Berlin Clock Patterns to improve code reusability. 

The Berlin Clock can be redesigned according to the user by setting up the hourLimit, minuteLimit and the secondLimit variable parameter in the print methods. We can also change the number of slots by changing the slot variable. 

There is a method called setColorScheme which will help the user to set the color scheme which the user wishes to see on the Berlin Clock. The user can also go for the default color scheme of the Berlin Clock.

The user can also test the application by uncommenting the unitTest method call in the main method and commenting the do while loop.
